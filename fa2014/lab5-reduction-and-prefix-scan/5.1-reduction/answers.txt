QUESTION:

How many times does a single thread block synchronize to reduce its portion of 
the array to a single value?

ANSWER:
A thread block will synchronize after completing a stride. Since each thread
block will have up to 10 strides (log2(2 * BLOCK_SIZE)) it will synchronize 10
times.

QUESTION:

What is the minimum, maximum, and average number of "real" operations that a 
thread will perform? "Real" operations are those that directly contribute to
the final reduction value.

ANSWER:
The minimum number of real operations = 1 (ex threadIdx.x 511 contributes to
the partial sum for just 1 stride)
The maximum number of real operations = 10 (ex threadIdx.x 0 contributes to
the partial sum for all 10 strides)
The average number of real operations is about 2. That's because half the
threads perform 1 operation, a fourth perform 2 operations, an 8th perform 3
operations, and so on. This averages to about 2.
