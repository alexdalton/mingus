QUESTION:

What is the FLOPS rate for the GPU kernel in this application? How does it 
scale with the size of the input image? To answer this question, try multiple 
input sizes (five is a good number) and calculate the rate for each then 
compare. Only include floating point additions and multiplications when 
calculating the total number of operations. Use the kernel timing measurements 
provided in the code for calculating the execution time.

ANSWER:














QUESTION:

What percentage of time is spent as overhead for using the GPU? Consider as 
overhead: device memory allocation time and memory copy time to and from the 
device. Do not include problem setup time or result verification time in your 
calculations of overhead or total execution time. Try this with multiple input 
sizes and explain how the overhead scales with the size of your input.
