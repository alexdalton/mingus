Describe all optimizations you tried regardless of whether you committed to 
them or abandoned them and whether they improved or hurt performance. For each 
optimization, include in your report:
  > A description of the optimization
  > Any difficulties you had with completing the optimization correctly
  > The change in execution time after the optimization was applied
  > An explanation of why you think the optimization helped or hurt performance
